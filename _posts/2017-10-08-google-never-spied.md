A recent investigation by the FBI has found Google does not store any of the private information of its user and browsers. The investigative team, who started their inquisition in August, found that Google does not store user data such as ad profiles or address information, citing the main reason being lack of space to store said data.

Google executives were quick to deny the claim, "we make a pledge to our users to keep their information secure with us," Google spokesperson Gary Illyes told CNN Europe, "we have at least a billion, maybe even a trillion user profiles on hand at any given time, we promised this to our users, and we can promise you this investigation is as untrue as it is biased". Google has since taken down the FBI's website from its search algoritms in response.

FBI spokesperson Michael P. Kortan, in a press briefing, said the Bureau has been disappointed that Google has not met their requested standards of user tracking. "We ask major tech corporations like Google, Microsoft and Apple to track their users as to provide their safety and show the administration they can be relied upon for national interests. We are sad to say Google has not met those standards, and we will be monitoring Google's further activities".
